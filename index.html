            Agriculture is the art and science of cultivating the soil, growing crops and raising livestock. It includes the preparation of plant and animal products for people to use and their distribution to markets. Agriculture provides most of the world's food and fabrics. Agriculture is sometimes thought of as farming, but agriculture is actually much more than just farming.  Agriculture includes dairy, fruit cultivation, forestry, harvesting of honey, and much more!  Our agriculture is important to the survival of our country.  Without agriculture, our country would be starving and our economy would plummet dramatically. What if agriculture was nonexistent ???

In equilibrium, a given economy may be the most efficient producer of both agriculture and manufactures. But if its comparative advantage is in manufactures, it will import agricultural products.  If women had equal access to opportunities and resources, they could increase their yields and feed more hungry people in the world. In fact, if women had the same access to productive resources as men, they could increase their farm yields by 20-30 percent, feeding an additional 150 million people..</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Basic Skills To Learn By Beginners </h5>
                <p class="card-text"><u> Farm Operations Skills: <p></u> This is the general farm management skills that you need to perform day to day basic duties on the farm</p>
                <p><u> Crop and Animal Management Skills: </u> These skills are important because they will enable you to grow or raise your animals e.g. How to grow, How to raise animals, Harvesting etc </p>
                <p> <u>Interpersonal Skills: </u> Agricultural professionals who work in the supply chain management, interpersonal skills are incredibly important. You are routinely required to interact with farmers who produce the farm products, and deliver these goods to other companies and institutions. Having strong interpersonal skills is necessary for sales, marketing, advertising or an area of expertise that relies on strategic communication </p>
                <p> <u> Value Chain Knowledge: </u> When you get into farming you need to be well versed with the value chain or value addition process. The value chain involves a full range of value adding activities required to bring a product or service through the different phases of production, including procurement of raw materials and other inputs. To know how to add value to your produce helps you on how to generate more profit. </p>
                <p><u>Time Management:</u>  Beginner farmers need to know how to manage their time as they practice farming. Farmers are tasked with ensuring that farm produce are properly transported, stored and delivered from producer, to wholesaler, to consumer. This is very important to ensure success of the business. </p>
                <p><u>Technical Skills: </u> These are agricultural technical skills on how to use farm implements, disease management and direction on farm chemicals. If you are doing dairy farming you need to go for training to get practical and theoretical knowledge on how to take care of your herd. The same applies to crop production and other animal husbandry. </p>
                <p><u>Marketing Skills: </u> Most agricultural produce are marketable on their own because they are among the basic human needs. However this does not necessarily mean that marketing is not important in farming. This often arises when there is a surplus of a specific commodity in your region and more marketing action are needed to sell your farm produce elsewhere. </p>
                <p> <u> Record Keeping: </u> Every farmer needs to have a record keeping system  in agribusiness. This will enable them to have a systematic flow of inputs and outputs on their farms. It will also control financial issues that arise on the farm by showing the flow of money within the  enterprise (Income and Expenses). Some of the  Softwares that help to keep a record are Financial Management Software, Dairy Management Software, Crop Production Software. </p>

                   <p>Water Scarcity is a greatest problem in Agriculture. The growing scarcity of fresh water has motivated the use of non-conventional and re-used water resources for agriculture by applying some efficient technologies. The desalination technologies for agricultural irrigation play a major role in satisfying growing water demands in water scarce regions. Due to stringent ionic concentration standards for agricultural irrigation water, desalination for agriculture is more energy demanding and additional post-treatment is requisite. Reverse osmosis (RO) has emerged as an efficient technology.</p>
                  <p>Solar desalination is a technique to produce water with a low salt concentration from sea-water or brine using solar energy. There are two common methods of solar desalination. Either using the direct heat from the sun or using electricity generated by solar cells to power a membrane process. This can be overcomed by Solar Desalination Techniques </p>

                   <p>The major challenge is to double the income of farmers in three years, rather making the farming remunerative so that the young generation may be attracted towards it. Today’s paradox is that on one side we have enough production, stores are full, middlemen and consumers are happy that they get what they want at reasonable prices but on the other hand the farmers are driven to suicides as they are unable to  maintain their families on their farm income. We have adopted a classical model of minimum support price (MSP) for a long time to help farmers from price distress and market fluctuations. We are also ensuring to fix the prices above the cost of cultivation. Unfortunately, MSP operation is limited to states and crops.  For perishable goods it is difficult to be used. Therefore, the farmers are throwing the vegetables, milk and such perishable commodities on road as a protest for better returns. To improve the share of farmers in the price paid by consumers, a different strategy has to be adopted. The solution lies in market reforms and altering the structure of APMC Act.  Model APMC act has never been implemented in spite of several efforts made in the past. The all-round market reforms can ensure better price through direct negotiations between the producer and consumer.</p>

                   <p> There are several good examples of such marketing reforms, which are needed to be universally implemented. Similarly, the Essential Commodity Act has created an environment of uncertainty and discourages entry of large players into agriculture infrastructure in the country. Maharashtra has shown the way as to how small holder farmers can come together in the form of ‘Gatsheti’ (Farmers’ Producing Groups) that can scale up production and then bargain for remunerative price returns, a win-win situation for both, the farmer and consumer.  </p>

                    The Internet of Things (IoT) technology allows farmers to have complete supervision and clarity on the wellbeing of their livestock, which is a direct factor of the overall farm’s performance. In the example we have covered above, professional growers are able to improve sustainability and profitability by gaining the ability to predict future problems using IoT. Even though the technology is being adopted at an increasingly faster pace, it still has a long way to go development-wise. Despite this, this innovation is already making the lives of farmers easier and it will do an even better job in the near future.It also increases crop productivity.
